# Workshop HARDWARE - Introduction to Arduino

## Introduction
This workshop is an introduction to arduino, you should do the exercices in the proposed order.
Even if searching for online tutorials is authorized, we suggest you to try by yourself first.

## Setup
To carry out this workshop, you need to create an account on [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com).

**When you are logged in:**
* On the left of your dashboard, click on "**circuts**"
* And then, click on "**Create a circut**"

>We suggest you to create a different circut for each exercise, you will probably want to draw inspiration from your previous exercises to carry out the following ones.

## Exercice 1

<details>
    <summary> ðŸ›  required Material:</summary>

* Arduino
* BreadBoard
* Cable USB
* Jumpers
* LED
* Resistor

</details>

**Instruction**: Make a circuit connecting an LED to an Arduino and turn on this LED.

>**Constraints**: You will not need to use ANY CODE for this exercise. You are not allowed to use the 3.3V pin of your board.

>:warning: Is the voltage accepted by the LED compatible with the voltage produced by the board?

## Exercice 2

<details>
    <summary> ðŸ›  required Material:</summary>

* Arduino
* BreadBoard
* Cable USB
* Jumpers
* LED
* Resistor
* Switch

</details>

**Instruction**: Use the circut of the previous exercise, but this time add a switch in order to be able to turn on and off the LED.

>**Constraints**: You will not need to use ANY CODE for this exercise. You are not allowed to use the 3.3V pin of your board.

## Exercice 3

<details>
    <summary> ðŸ›  required Material:</summary>

* Arduino
* BreadBoard
* Cable USB
* Jumpers
* LED
* Resistor

</details>

**Instruction**: Make a LED blink every second

## Exercice 4

<details>
    <summary> ðŸ›  required Material:</summary>

* Arduino
* BreadBoard
* Cable USB
* Jumpers
* 6 Resistors
* 6 LEDs

</details>

**Instruction**: Do you know [K2000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xgin4DpdzZU&ab_channel=Retrovery)? Let's do KITT's front light. Turn on and off 6 LEDs, one at a time, in a back and forth motion.

## Exercice 5

<details>
    <summary> ðŸ›  required Material:</summary>

* Arduino
* BreadBoard
* Cable USB
* Jumpers
* 6 LEDs
* 6 Resistors
* Potentiometer

</details>

**Instruction**: Using the circut of the previous exercise, vary the speed of the back and forth with a potentiometer.


## Exercice 6

<details>
    <summary> ðŸ›  required Material:</summary>

* Arduino
* BreadBoard
* Cable USB
* Jumpers
* LED
* Resistor
* Potentiometer

</details>

**Instruction**: Vary the intensity of an LED with a potentiometer

>**Constraints**: The potentiometer and the led must be in two different circuts

>:bulb: Try to learn more about the "PWM" pins
>:bulb: You may want to select different levels of intensity (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)

## Exercice 7

<details>
    <summary> ðŸ›  required Material:</summary>

* Arduino
* BreadBoard
* Cable USB
* Jumpers
* LED
* 2 Resistors
* Button

</details>

**Instruction**: Turn on and off a LED each time you push a button

## Exercice 8

<details>
    <summary> ðŸ›  required Material:</summary>

* Arduino
* BreadBoard
* Cable USB
* Jumpers
* LED
* Resistor
* Ultrasonic distance sensor

</details>

**Instruction**: Turn on an LED when the distance sensor reads a distance less than 1 metre

## Exercice 9

<details>
    <summary> ðŸ›  required Material:</summary>

* Arduino
* BreadBoard
* Cable USB
* Jumpers
* LED
* Resistor
* Ultrasonic distance sensor

</details>

**Instruction**: Make an RGB LED go from red to blue depending on the distance detected by the distance sensor

## Exercice 10

<details>
    <summary> ðŸ›  required Material:</summary>

* Arduino
* BreadBoard
* Cable USB
* Jumpers
* Servo-motor
* Resistor
* Piezoelectric sensor

</details>

**Instruction**: Move from left to right then from right to left a servo-motor and make a sound of 500Hz each time the servo-motor change direction
